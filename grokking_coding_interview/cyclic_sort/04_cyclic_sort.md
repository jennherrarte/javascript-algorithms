### Cylic Sort 

```
We are given an array containing n objects. Each object, when created, was assigned a unique number from the range 1 to n based on their creation sequence. This means that the object with sequence number 3 was created just before the object with sequence number 4.

Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in O(n)
and without using any extra space. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we are passed an integer array containing only the sequence numbers, though each number is actually an object.
```
```
**Example 1:**
Input: [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Example 2:**
Input: [2, 6, 4, 3, 1, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

**Example 3:**
Input: [1, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
```js
function cyclic_sort(nums) {
    let i = 0;
    while(i < nums.length) {
        let j = nums[i] - 1;

        if(nums[i] !== nums[j]) {
           [nums[i], nums[j]] = [nums[i], nums[j]]
        } else {
            i++
        }
    };
 
    return nums;
}
