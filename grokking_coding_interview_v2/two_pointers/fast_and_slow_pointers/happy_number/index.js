// SECTION Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is a happy number.

// NOTE - Pseudocode 
// We use the following process to check if a given number is a happy number:
// Starting with the given number n, replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits.
// Repeat the process until:
  // The number equals 1, which will depict that the given number nis a happy number.
  // It enters a cycle, which will depict that the given number n is not a happy number.
// Return TRUE if n is a happy number, and FALSE if not.
